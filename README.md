# Blockchain Based Approach To Encourage Student Engagement on Campus

On-campus activities like positions of responsibility in campus amenities and participation in research, benefit the students as well as the university, while also making students financially self-sufficient to  a  certain extent.  However,  this  student  participation  is stymied  by  lack  of awareness and motivation. Significant impetus to innovation and student participation can be provided by incentivization of these activities. In this paper, we propose a system to create a blockchain-based economy, to incentivize students with empirical benefits or monetary awards calculated using objective algorithms. The incentivization algorithms have been  designed for three  promising  use  cases:  research  work,  positions  of  responsibility  in  universities,  and crowdfunding. The demonstrated implementation of this system utilises VJTI Chain, an already established  Proof  of  Authority  blockchain in  VJTI  Mumbai,  India.  This  creates  a  circular economy within the university which encourages students to earn more rewards by reinforcing positive feedback.
